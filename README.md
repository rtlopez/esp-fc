# Documentation

In this repository you can find firmware code that allows you to build your own flight controller. For convenience it mimics Betaflight 4.2 compability, so that it can be configured using [betaflight-configurator](https://github.com/betaflight/betaflight-configurator). Also [online blackbox-log-viewer](https://blackbox.betaflight.com/) can be used to analyze blackbox logs. In most aspects it is similar to Betaflight, so that many configuration and tuning advices are helpfull here too. But you must be aware, that this software is not the same as Betaflight, there are some limitations and differences in functionality and performance.

# Quick Start

## Requirements

Hardware:
* ESP32 or ESP32-S3 board
* MPU9250 SPI or MPU6050 I2C gyro (GY-88, GY-91, GY-521 or similar)
* PDB with 5V BEC
* Buzzer and some electronic components (optional).

Software:
* [Betaflight Configurator](https://github.com/betaflight/betaflight-configurator/releases) (v10.10)
* [CH340 usb-serial converter driver](https://sparks.gogo.co.nz/ch340.html)

## Flashing

1. Download and unpack selected firmware from [Releases Page](https://github.com/rtlopez/esp-fc/releases)
2. Visit [ESP Tool Website](https://espressif.github.io/esptool-js/)
3. Click "Connect" and choose device port in dialog
4. Add firmware file and set Flash Address to `0x00`
5. Click "Program"
6. After success power cycle board

## Setup

After flashing you need to configure few things first:

 1. Configure pinout according to your wiring, especially pin functions, you can find more information in [CLI Reference](/docs/cli.md)
 2. Connect to [Betaflight Configurator](https://github.com/betaflight/betaflight-configurator/releases) and setup to your preferences,
 3. Test motors without propellers
 4. Have fun ;)

> [!NOTE]
> Not all functions displayed in configurator are avalable in firmware. The rule of thumb is if you cannot change specific option in Betaflight Configurator, that means it is not supported. It usually rolls back to previous value after save. It is strongly recommended to follow [setup guide](/docs/setup.md).
